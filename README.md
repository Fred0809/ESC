# ESC
This is an ongoing project on ESC. It is currently designed for 2S-6S batteries. Together with PDU and FCU it will make up a 6 motor drone.
The idea uses screw terminal for battery inputs and JST-XH connector to FCU. In the project uses 3.3V for ESC's MCU coming from FCU. The FCU will be using CAN bus for controlling ESCs and getting telemetry just to see how it works out.
